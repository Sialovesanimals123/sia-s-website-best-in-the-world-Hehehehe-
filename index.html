            Hello, my name is SIA UPADHYAY. I am currently in the process of planning my future, with aspirations to pursue a career as a space scientist. However, I must patiently wait until im older. Despite this, I am fortunate to have a supportive family, including an encouraging sister, and mum and dad, alongside grandma and my cute little birds.

    <br><br>
            Currently, I reside in a 2-storey house with my family in Australia. I am passionate about a variety of hobbies, such as filming (particularly skilled in this area), building (using Lego and other materials), arts and crafts, drawing, coding, cooking, talking to food(or people),  eating food, directing, and creating gamesâ€”all of which I excel in and deeply enjoy. This website serves as a platform to explore my hobbies, who I am and my coding work. Enjoy exploring my world through this website !
